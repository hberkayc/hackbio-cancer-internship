The Importance of Transcriptomics in Cancer Diagnosis and Personalized Treatments

The central dogma of molecular biology concerns the flow of genetic information throughout an organism. It was first stated by Francis Crick in 1957 and later published in 1958 as "DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein", (Crick, 1958). However, throughout the years, we have discovered that retroviruses can produce DNA from their RNA using a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase. With this enzyme, we have developed new methods and technologies such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), real-time PCR (qRT-PCR, (Clark et al., 2019) etc. These novel technologies leveled up the diagnosis, and eventually detection of biomarkers to diagnose a cancer patient, into daily usage—all of these lay emphasis on the importance of transcriptomics.

The study of the RNA transcripts that the genotype produces at a specific moment, known as transcriptomics, establishes a connection between the proteome, the genome, and the cellular phenotype. It is a global approach that has been developed recently together with proteomics, metabolomics, and genomes (Cocolin & Rantsiou, 2014). Total RNA sequencing, mRNA sequencing, and targeted RNA sequencing can be counted as recent transcriptomics technologies. These novel approaches make us closer to discovering new treatments. Analyzing these datas, we can identify differentially expressed (upregulated/downregulated) genes, most importantly oncogenes (Ras) and tumor suppressor genes (BRCA, TP53). Understanding and interpreting these specific conditions allows personalized treatments for patients for enhanced and accurate results.

Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells develop uncontrollably and produce tumors. If left untreated, tumors can spread throughout the body and be fatal. In 2022, 2.3 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer, and 670,000 died worldwide. Breast cancer affects women of all ages after puberty, but the incidence rises later in life (_Breast Cancer_, n.d.).

The "BRCA" word stands for "BReast CAncer Gene." BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two distinct genes linked to a person's risk of developing breast cancer. Despite their name, they don’t cause (unless they’re mutated/repressed) breast cancer. They play a tumor suppressor role via their DNA repair mechanisms (_BRCA_, n.d.). Studies have shown that mutations in these tumor suppressor genes lead to tumor formation and proliferation of cancerous cells. It can also lead to more aggressive and resistant tumors to treatments (_BRCA Gene Mutations_, 2024).  

Also, several studies have shown that a woman's risk of breast cancer is linked to the estrogen and progesterone produced by her ovaries. Long-term exposure to these hormones, as well as high amounts, has been associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer (_Risk Factors_, 2015).
